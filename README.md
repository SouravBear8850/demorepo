# demorepo
A repository is like a folder for your project. Your project's repository contains all of your project's files and stores each file's revision history. You can also discuss and manage your project's work within the repository.

## Creating a new repository
You can create a new repository on your personal account or any organization where you have sufficient permissions.

Tip: Owners can restrict repository creation permissions in an organization. For more information, see "Restricting repository creation in your organization."

Tip: You can also create a repository using the GitHub CLI. For more information, see "gh repo create" in the GitHub documentation.

### In the upper-right corner of any page, use the  drop-down menu, and select New repository.

#### Optionally, to create a repository with the directory structure and files of an existing repository, use the Choose a template drop-down and select a template repository. You'll see template repositories that are owned by you and organizations you're a member of or that you've used before. For more information, see "Creating a repository from a template."

Optionally, if you chose to use a template, to include the directory structure and files from all branches in the template, and not just the default branch, select Include all branches.

### Include all branches checkbox
In the Owner drop-down, select the account you wish to create the repository on.

### Owner drop-down menu
Type a name for your repository, and an optional description.

### Create repository field
Choose a repository visibility. For more information, see "About repository visibility."

### Radio buttons to select repository visibility
If you're not using a template, there are a number of optional items you can pre-populate your repository with. If you're importing an existing repository to GitHub, don't choose any of these options, as you may introduce a merge conflict. You can add or create new files using the user interface or choose to add new files using the command line later. For more information, see "Importing a Git repository using the command line," "Adding a file to a repository using the command line," and "Addressing merge conflicts."

### You can create a README 
which is a document describing your project. For more information, see "About READMEs."

### You can create a .gitignore file
which is a set of ignore rules. For more information, see "Ignoring files."

### You can choose to add a software license for your project.
For more information, see "Licensing a repository."
